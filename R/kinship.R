#' Functions for calculating kinship matrices
#'
#' A collection of functions for calculating kinship matrices using different
#' algorithms. The following algorithms are included: astle (Astle and Balding,
#' 2009), Identity By State (IBS) and VanRaden (VanRaden, 2008) for
#' marker matrices.
#'
#' @section Marker matrices:
#' In all algorithms the input matrix \code{X} is first cleaned, i.e. markers
#' with a variance of 0 are excluded from the calculation of the kinship matrix.
#' Then some form of scaling is done which differs per algorithm. This gives a
#' scaled matrix \code{Z}. The matrix \eqn{ZZ^t / denominator} is returned.
#' By default the denominator is equal to the number of columns in \code{Z} for
#' \code{astle} and \code{IBS} and \eqn{2 * p * (1-p)} where
#' \eqn{p = colSums(X) / (2 * nrow(X))} for \code{vanRaden}. This denominator
#' can be overwritten by the user, e.g. when computing kinship matrices by
#' splitting \code{X} in smaller matrices and then adding the results together
#' in the end.
#'
#' @param X An n x m marker matrix with genotypes in the rows (n) and markers in
#' the columns (m).
#' @param method The method used for computing the kinship matrix. 
#' @param denominator A numerical value. See details.
#'
#' @return An n x n kinship matrix.
