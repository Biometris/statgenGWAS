#' DROPS data sets
#' 
#' This dataset comes from the European Union project DROPS (DROught-tolerant 
#' yielding PlantS). A panel of 256 maize hybrids was grown with two water 
#' regimes (irrigated or rainfed), in seven fields in 2012 and 2013, 
#' respectively, spread along a climatic transect from western to eastern 
#' Europe, plus one site in Chile in 2013. This resulted in 28 experiments 
#' defined as the combination of one year, one site and one water regime, with 
#' two and three repetitions for rainfed and irrigated treatments, respectively.
#' A detailed environmental characterisation was carried out, with hourly 
#' records of micrometeorological data and soil water status, and associated
#' with precise measurement of phenology. Grain yield and its components were
#' measured at the end of the experiment. The main purpose of this dataset 
#' consists in using the environmental characterisation to quantify the genetic
#' variability of maize grain yield in response to the environmental drivers
#' for genotype-by-environment interaction. For instance, allelic effects at
#' QTLs identified over the field network are consistent within a scenario but
#' largely differ between scenarios. \cr\cr 
#' The data is split in three separate data.frames.

#' \item{\strong{dropsMarkers}}{This data.frame contains the 50K genotyping 
#' matrix coded in allelic dose (012) filtered and imputed. Genotyping of 
#' 41,722 loci on 246 parental lines were obtained using 50K Illumina Infinium 
#' HD arrays (Ganal et al., 2011). Genotype were coded in allelic dose with 0 
#' for the minor allele, 1 for the heterozygote, and 2 for the major allele.
